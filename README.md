**Electric Grid Stability using ANN** is a machine learning project that predicts electric grid stability using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). It analyzes parameters like voltage, frequency, and load to identify patterns and detect potential instabilities. The model aims to provide early warnings to prevent outages and ensure grid reliability.
